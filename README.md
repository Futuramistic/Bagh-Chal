Bagh-chal is a strategic two player board game, which originates
from Nepal. The game is asymmetric – both players control different
number of pieces (“The Tiger” controls four pieces and “The Goat” controls
up to twenty pieces) and have different winning conditions. The goal for
“The Tiger” is to hunt down the goats while “The Goat” tries to block all the
tigers. The game is played normally on 5x5 point grid, where pieces are
positioned on the intersections of the lines. Valid moves between are
indicated by connecting lines.

## Game Phases
The game is played in two phases:
1. “The Goat” places the pieces on the board while tigers are being moved. The first phase is finished when
every goat pawn is placed on the board.
2. Both tigers and goats are moved.
Initial game setup
At the start of the game all four tigers are placed in the four corners of the grid, facing the center. No goats are
placed on the board during the initial setup. “The Goat” moves first.
